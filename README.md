What is Bitcoin Backup (BTCB)?
------------------------------
Bitcoin Backup (BTCB) is a hot-spare version of bitcoin, with every potential
point-of-failure fortified with at least two secure alternatives.  BTCB is 
post-quantum safe, and designed for immunity against algorithm backdoors, 
failures, and breakage.  Everyone with BTC automatically receives the 
equivalent in BTCB.
